# Sorting Visualizer

A web-based tool to visualize and understand how different sorting algorithms work. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project is perfect for students, educators, and anyone curious about sorting algorithms.

## ✨ Features

- **Visualize**: See how sorting algorithms rearrange data step by step.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the animation speed with a slider.
- **Custom Array Size**: Set the number of values to sort (5–100).
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile browsers.
- **No Dependencies**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no build tools required.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
2. Use the **Speed** slider to adjust animation speed (10ms–1000ms).
3. Set the **Number of Values** (5–100) to change the array size.
4. Click **Init** to generate a new random array.
5. Click any sorting algorithm button to start the visualization.
6. Watch the bars animate as the algorithm sorts the array!
